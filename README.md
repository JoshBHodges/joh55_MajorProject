# Developing an AI controller for Ms. Pacman

The purpose of this Major Project is to develop an AI controller for the non-deterministic game 
(agents can act at random) of Ms. Pac-Man, which is a difficult game for human players let alone 
an AI controller. This is because of the randomness of the ghosts, unlike Pac-Man in which the ghosts 
follow a specific pattern. This allows the controller and human players to pick up on these patterns 
and use them to avoid ghosts when playing the game.

## Getting Started

Once you extract the zip file containing the sorce code and the runnable jar you should be able to
run the script file called StartLearner.sh. this file will run the learner with the default configuration
without any training.

All the code that I developed is in the two classes contained in the folder
\src\main\java\entrants\pacman\username

### Prerequisites

The only thing needed to run this code is a copy of java installed on the system.
